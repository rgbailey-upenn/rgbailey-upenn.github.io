I am a Doctoral Student in City & Regional Planning at the Weitzman School of Design. My primary field is Housing, Community & Economic Development (HCED). I study the social and economic conditions of marginalized communities in the United States and the collective body of institutions, policies, and strategies designed to improve physical conditions, reduce poverty and deprivation, and promote equity. My research topic centers on the political economy of market-based reforms to public housing.

Before entering the Doctoral Program, I worked in several affordable and supportive housing roles, including as a program manager for the Rental Assistance Demonstration for the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA).

I received a Bachelor of Arts in Economics and a minor in African and African American Studies from Stanford University, a Master in City Planning from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Department of Urban Studies & Planning, and a Master of Science in Social Policy from the University of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s School of Social Policy & Practice.
