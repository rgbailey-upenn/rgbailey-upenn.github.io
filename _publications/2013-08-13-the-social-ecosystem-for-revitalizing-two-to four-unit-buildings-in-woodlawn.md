The social ecosystem approach explores the individuals and organizations that help effect a
particular social outcome and the factors within their environment that contribute to or hinder their
success. When applied to the particular housing and community development challenge facing 2-4
unit properties in the Chicago neighborhood of Woodlawn, the standard social ecosystem model is
augmented by an explicit incorporation of a development process to emphasize the importance of
the entrepreneurial, financial, technical and undeniably social aspects of real estate in revitalizing
urban communities. The research sets out to explore the historical causes and processes that led to
vacancy and market decline; the current condition of the market and neighborhood; lessons learned
from previous efforts; and the parameters of action imposed by important stakeholder interests.

This analysis reveals how population loss, speculation fueled by unrealized hopes of gentrification
and accumulated property-level delinquencies combine to sustain high vacancies in Woodlawn.
Recent declines in homeownership, depressed property values, a shortage of local amenities and
structural barriers lowering investor margins also inhibit sustainable building uses in favor of
landlords who “milk” properties and target Housing Choice Voucher Recipients. Due to the lack of
social capital, the neighborhood struggles to control violence and maintain the public realm. The
consequence is a diminished ability to attract prospective residents despite considerable local assets.

The proposed response advances five strategic outcomes: stabilization of the market; advocacy for
both better policy and internal structure; expansion of loans and financial assistance for
homeowners; expansion of technical assistance and counseling for homeowners; and the
prioritization of local development approaches that spread benefits more equitably than is typical of
gentrification. The associated recommendations, which broadly consider policy, planning and
community development, seek to create a synergy capable of addressing the challenges identified by
the social ecosystem framework and build on existing strengths and opportunities in Woodlawn.
